### VI  

Plato thought nature but a spume that plays  

Upon a ghostly paradigm of things;  

Solider Aristotle played the taws 

Upon the bottom of a king of kings;  

World-famous golden-thighed Pythagoras 

Fingered upon a fiddle-stick or strings  

What a star sang and careless Muses heard:  

Old clothes upon old sticks to scare a bird.
